# Malware-Paper
Research Paper on the many types of malware that have been made to harm various devices, services, and networks. My goal with this paper is to take a closer look into how different types of malware work and how they go about infecting systems, services, and networks, along side looking on how you can deal with malware to remove it. I also want to take a look at some of the more damaging malware attacks and they ways people used to deal with them.
